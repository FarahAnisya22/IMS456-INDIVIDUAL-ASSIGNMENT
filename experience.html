<center><h2> MY EXPERIENCE </H2></center>
<P>
I used to work at library of Khir Johari highschool as library assistance. Besides that, I also work as bakery as assisstance bakery 
with my aunt as homemade bakery as I get many knowledge about pastry food and cake. Moreover, I work about 5 month just to improve my experience
as I continued to work as donut worker at Tf Mart Sungai Petani to do as part time job because I have to add my pocket money. Soon after finishing diploma
I work as part-timer in Bandar Puteri Jaya middle school as bookstore assisstance to gain more experience and money. What I have gain from those work 
was social skills and effiency in doing the job as it can increase my confident to get into a intense working environment.
