<p>Speech from me :</p>

<p>
I would like to say thank you to Encik Mohd Firdaus Bin Mohd Helmi for giving me opportunities for making this assessment and give me more times in making this website greatly. 
Besides that, i would like to thanks all of my family member and classmate for always be there for me when I have many trouble and they always help me to 
solve it in this individual assignment and give me space for me. I also get many experience in making this website as they challenge my mind to get me thinking
throughoutly about the html lesson. IMS456 also one of the subject that i hard work for because this is not easy as early semester subject in IM244 course which 
is we have to focus on doing the coding of html precisely and decorate the website so that we can get good result succesfully. Last but not least, I wanna thank me for not giving up 
and steadily learning about this subject as the hard work pay off the good result and also I want to thank to our god, Allah SWT for giving me strength and 
good mental so that I can do this assignment with good conditions.
